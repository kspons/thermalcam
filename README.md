# Setup
This package requires use of v4l2loopback and ThermAppCam 
First, download and install v4l2loopback from https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback

Second, download and build thermapp from https://github.com/Pidbip/ThermAppCam/tree/master/thermapp

Make sure that thermapp is working and you can see a live feed from the Thermapp camera. To do this, use
```
sudo modprobe videodev
cd ~/v4l2loopback
sudo insmod ./v4l2loopback.ko devices=2
cd ~/ThermAppCam/thermapp
sudo ./thermapp
```
using vlc, or other video stream viewer, you should be able to see the live feed from the thermal camera.

Start a rosmaster, or use the cameras.launch to begin using the package.
